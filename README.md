This is for my project in ICY0006 - Probability Theory and Statistics, at TalTech University.  
This project is a working project and will be developed in the fllowing months.  
Due to problems witht the original chosen dataset, a new dataset was chosen and the whole project was reworked from the 18/11-20.  
A second dataset was chosen and the repository for this was created the 17/12-20.  

To read the report select the file "matryg_Notebook.html" and open it in your browser. Since the file is too big to read directly in GitHub you have to save the file to your desktop and then open the saved file in your browser.
